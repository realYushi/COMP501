            Social media has become an integral part of modern society, shaping how we communicate, access information, and engage with the world. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have revolutionized communication, crossing borders and enabling real-time information sharing. These platforms facilitate social connections, support educational activities, and provide a space for community building and self-expression, particularly for marginalized groups. Social media also plays a crucial role in societal trends, political movements, and marketing strategies, significantly influencing public opinion and consumer behavior.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            However, the widespread use of social media comes with substantial risks. Issues such as excessive screen time, cyberbullying, negative social comparisons, and privacy concerns affect users of all ages, with teenagers being particularly vulnerable. These challenges highlight the need for balanced social media use and increased digital literacy. Focusing on teenagers, this website offers insights into how social media impacts their social development and mental health.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            By understanding these effects, parents, educators, and policymakers can implement strategies to help teenagers navigate social media responsibly. Practical measures include promoting healthy online habits, providing digital literacy education, and creating supportive environments both online and offline. By exploring the dual nature of social media's impact on society and focusing on the unique challenges faced by teenagers, we aim to provide comprehensive guidance for leveraging the benefits of social media while mitigating its risks.
