        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Social media significantly influences teenagers' social development and mental health, offering both profound opportunities and serious challenges. While it provides a platform for enhancing social connections and engaging in educational activities, it also exposes teenagers to various risks that can negatively affect their social interactions and emotional well-being. The widespread nature of social media can lead to excessive screen time, reducing physical activities and face-to-face interactions. This shift can result in increased sedentary behavior, potentially leading to obesity and associated health issues. Additionally, the constant exposure to curated and idealized portrayals of others' lives fosters negative social comparisons among teenagers. Such comparisons can diminish self-esteem and escalate feelings of inadequacy, leading to depressive symptoms as teens struggle to meet unrealistic standards.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Cyberbullying is another significant risk associated with social media. Teenagers are particularly vulnerable online, where aggression can occur through public posts, private messages, or exclusion from digital groups. The anonymity and distance provided by digital platforms can embolden individuals to engage in hurtful behavior that they might avoid in person. This can easily target groups or individuals, severely impacting the victimâ€™s mental health. Such exposure not only normalizes aggressive interactions but can also lead to the internalization of such behaviors, with victims potentially becoming perpetrators themselves. The lack of sensory cues and the distant nature of digital communication also complicate how teenagers interpret social interactions, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. Additionally, the pressure to be always available can strain relationships, making interactions feel burdensome and reducing the quality of friendships. Social media can also encourage antisocial behaviors like phubbing, where individuals ignore their physical companions to focus on their digital devices, leading to feelings of neglect and isolation.
