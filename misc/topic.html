        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Social media has become an integral part of modern life, especially for teenagers. It provides a platform for communication, self-expression, and information sharing, deeply influencing their social interactions and development. In todayâ€™s digital age, social media is not just a tool but a large aspect of teenage life. It enables teenagers to maintain and build relationships with peers, family, and others, regardless of geographical barriers. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok provide quick access to news, educational content, and various forms of entertainment, making them essential for staying connected and informed in our modern society.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Beyond individual use, social media's influence extends to broader society. Teenagers often set and follow trends on social media, influencing popular culture and societal norms. Platforms provide a space for young people to engage in social and political movements, raising awareness and advocating for change. Social media has also transformed marketing and consumer behavior, with teenagers being the largest target demographic. Companies leverage their platforms and harvested data to reach young audiences, influencing their purchasing decisions and cultural preferences.
